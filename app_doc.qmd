To perform a simple simulation sample size to explore all parameters you can use our TKinter application which is a graphical interface user.

In your terminal execute the following command:

```
python3 run_simualtion_terminal_job.py
```

A tkinter window is open and you can adjust same parameters that in **IDE Execution** part. After parameters choose, click on *run simulation* and in the tabview **sample size results** you obtain optimal sample size table and in **graphics** you obtain graphics which study  $\alpha$, $\beta$ and MSE results in function of sample size.
